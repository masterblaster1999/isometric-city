# IsoCity

IsoCity is a open-source isometric city-building simulation game built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It leverages the HTML5 Canvas API for high-performance rendering of isometric graphics, featuring complex systems for economic simulation, trains, planes, seaplanes, helicopters, cars, pedestrians, and more.

## Features

-   **Isometric Rendering Engine**: Custom-built rendering system using HTML5 Canvas (`CanvasIsometricGrid`) capable of handling complex depth sorting and layer management.
-   **Dynamic Simulation**:
    -   **Traffic System**: Autonomous vehicles including cars, trains, and aircraft (planes/seaplanes).
    -   **Pedestrian System**: Pathfinding and crowd simulation for city inhabitants.
    -   **Economy & Resources**: Resource management, zoning (Residential, Commercial, Industrial), and city growth logic.
-   **Interactive Grid**: Tile-based placement system for buildings, roads, parks, and utilities.
-   **State Management**: Save/Load functionality for multiple cities.
-   **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with specialized touch controls and toolbars.

## Tech Stack

-   **Framework**: [Next.js 14+](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
-   **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) & [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components.
-   **Graphics**: HTML5 Canvas API (No external game engine libraries; pure native implementation).
-   **Icons**: Lucide React.

## Procedural Sprite Packs (Experimental)

This project includes an **experimental procedural sprite pack** that generates sprite sheets at runtime using the Canvas 2D API (no `.webp` / `.png` required for that pack).

- **Generator**: `src/lib/proceduralSpriteSheets.ts` (entrypoint: `generateProceduralSpriteSheetForKind(...)`)
- **Pack config**: `SPRITE_PACK_PROCEDURAL_BASIC` in `src/lib/renderConfig.ts`
- **Loading / registration**: `src/components/game/spriteSheetProvider.ts`

The generator can now procedurally create **all** sheet kinds the renderer knows about (main / construction / abandoned / dense / modern / parks / farms / shops / stations) as long as your pack provides the corresponding mappings (variants, parksBuildings, etc.).
### Procedural asset modes

You can also control procedural generation globally (even for the file-based packs) using an environment variable:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROCEDURAL_ASSETS_MODE=off` (default) → always load sprite sheets from files
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROCEDURAL_ASSETS_MODE=fallback` → try files, but generate procedural sheets if loading fails (handy if you remove `.webp`/`.png` assets)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROCEDURAL_ASSETS_MODE=force` → always generate procedural sheets (useful for “no-art-assets” deployments)

This behavior is implemented in `src/components/game/spriteSheetProvider.ts`.


To create your own procedural pack:

1. Copy `SPRITE_PACK_PROCEDURAL_BASIC` and change the `id` + `procedural.seed`.
2. Point the sheet sources at cache keys (for example `procedural:my-pack:main`).
3. Extend `styleForSpriteKey(...)` / `drawProceduralSpriteTile(...)` in `src/lib/proceduralSpriteSheets.ts` to add new sprite keys or new park/farm/shop/station visuals.

Tip: the generator uses lightweight prefixes internally (ex: `dense:apartment_high`, `park:basketball_courts`) to differentiate which kind of procedural art to draw.

If you want to add *your own* procedural sprites without modifying the core generator, use the extension registry:

- `src/lib/proceduralSpriteExtensions.ts` → `registerProceduralPrefixRenderer('my', ...)`
- Then reference sprites as `my:your_sprite_key` from a SpritePack.

- Or override an existing key directly (no prefix required): `registerProceduralSpriteRenderer('house_small', ...)`

- For pack-scoped overrides (recommended when you add a new procedural pack):
  - `registerProceduralSpriteRendererForPack('procedural-user', 'house_small', ...)`

- You can also insert brand-new procedural packs into the Settings UI at runtime:
  - `registerProceduralSpritePack('sprites4', { id: 'procedural-user', name: 'Procedural (User)', seed: 123 })`
  - See `src/lib/spritePackRegistry.ts` and the default implementation in `src/lib/proceduralUserAssets.ts`

- Settings UI: you can toggle between file assets and procedural generation under **Sprite Sheet Source** (uses localStorage override).

- A convenient place to register project-specific sprites is `src/lib/proceduralUserAssets.ts` (called once from `src/components/Game.tsx`)
